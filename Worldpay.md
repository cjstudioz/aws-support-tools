1.	Worldpay seems to offer a lot of services, how to tie the services offered here:
https://business.worldpay.com/lp/Merchant_Services_Brand
Back to whatâ€™s available in the APIs and hosted solutions here:
https://beta.developer.worldpay.com/docs

2.	What is the difference between the newer restful api 
https://beta.developer.worldpay.com/docs/access-worldpay
And the older
https://beta.developer.worldpay.com/docs/wpop
Is the newer one meant to superceed and replace the older one or do they perform different functions? 

3.	Do any of your hosted services provide the functionality to store a card per customer such that a returning customer can reuse existing card details without re-entering them? If not, does the hosted solution at least return the token so that We can store it on ourside to be re-used with your hosted solution?
